		<h1><p style="color:white;"> Project Objectives:</p></h1>
				<p> Plan, design and develop a simple Website for Stewardship Capital, including arranging whatever hosting/support contracts are necessary. The logo has been developed, but may need a little tweaking. The goal is to show that Stewardship Capital is legitimate, credible and backed by decades of experience and knowledge in the business/technology/healthcare services sector. Client-facing materials should convey a sense of accountability, responsibility, credibility and security.</p>
